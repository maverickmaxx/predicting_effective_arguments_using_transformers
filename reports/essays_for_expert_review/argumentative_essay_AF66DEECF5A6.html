    Scientists have been studying Venus for generations, wondering what could possibly be on a planet so close to ours. Now that we don't have to wonder anymore, NASA will try to take it one step higher. They want to be as close to Venus' ground as possible, without dying.

    Their plans are to use a blimp-like vehicle that will withstand the great amount of pressure and heat. It will fly thirty miles above the Venusian landscape, avoiding any ground conditions that would do them harm. It would still be 170 degrees F., but they would have an abundance of solar energy, and the radiation woud not exceed Earth levels.

    However, in order to learn all there is about Venus, you would have to go onto Venus. This is almost an impossible task though.

    There are many dangers on Venus, including sulfuric acid rain and an atmosphere of nintey seven percent carbon dioxide. Hovering over it would be useless. In paragraph six, it states, &quot;... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.&quot; This states that by hovering on top of the planet, they can't learn anyting they don't already know.

    My honest oppinion on this topic is that we should not be exploring Venus right now. We just don't have the right technology for it right now.

    We need to wait however many years before we can officially explore our sister planet. Trying to figure out its secrets now would just be a waste of time, money, and possibly lives. We shouldn't risk a human being just because this planet used to be like ours millions of years ago.
