    Hi, i'm Isaac, i'm going to be writing about how this face on Mars is a natural landform or if there is life on Mars that made it. The story is about how NASA took a picture of Mars and a face was seen on the planet. NASA doesn't know if the landform was created by life on Mars, or if it is just a natural landform.

    On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars. In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform

    I think that the face is a natural landform because there is no life on Mars that we have descovered yet

    If life was on Mars, we would know by now. The reason why I think it is a natural landform because, nobody live on Mars in order to create the figure. It says in paragraph 9, &quot;It's not easy to target Cydonia,&quot; in which he is saying that its not easy to know if it is a natural landform at this point. In all that they're saying, its probably a natural landform.

    People thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars.

    though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars.

    It says in paragraph 7, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin took a picture of Mars with his Orbiter Camera, that the face was a natural landform.

    Everyone who thought it was made by alieans even though it wasn't, was not satisfied. I think they were not satisfied because they have thought since 1976 that it was really formed by alieans.

    Though people were not satified about how the landform was a natural landform, in all, we new that alieans did not form the face. I would like to know how the landform was formed. we know now that life on Mars doesn't exist.
