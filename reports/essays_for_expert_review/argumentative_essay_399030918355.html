 and the Seagoing Cowboys are looking for volunteers!'' I yelled, straining to get their attention.</br></br>I thought to myself for a moment, and started to get attention again. I thought about how I was presenting myself, and what I would want to hear about this program if I were one of these townsfolk. I thought of an idea as I started to yell</br></br>'' Would you like to hear some of the adventures I had so you may be interested?'' I asked.</br></br>They all cried out,'' Yes please!''</br></br>''

.''

I exclaimed to the people of the town.</br></br>Everyone started asking if I would tell them what had happened on my journey.</br></br>I told them,'' The only way is to find out yourselves is you have to sign up and be at the docks in 3 weeks.'' I finished.</br></br>I hoped off the wooden box I was standing on, and I asked,'' Do you still want me to tell you two or three stories, and then you sign up?'' I questioned, again.</br></br>They all cried out,'' Yes!''</br></br>

    After being out of breath from persuading them to sign up, I thought that it was worth being out of breath. Now Don Reist and I have twenty extra helpers for our future trips to spots all over the world, and new friends to tell stories with.
