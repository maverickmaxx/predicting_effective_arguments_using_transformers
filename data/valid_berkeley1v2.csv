Five days are filled with this repeating schedule with two days to spare, and in my experience one of those days is set aside for weekend homework.

Almost everyone has seen in a movie how students throw their books and papers up in the air as soon as that last day bell rings. Imagine receiving a final project the last day of school, requiring students to turn in on the first day of their next year of school.

The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work.

Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for. From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration. ",Evidence,Effective

This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to.

While they likely do not have to pay for vehicle damages, if severe enough, injuries prevent them from performing their day to day activities and work functions, which may leave them unable to work and without money to survive.

If you're suddenly unable to partake in activities that you used to enjoy because of pain or a debilitating injury, it's no surprise you may become depressed"" (Myers Law Firm 2020).

These injuries may have caused a lack of mobility or body function, which hinders them from enjoying typical family or personal activities. Things they loved to do in the past that could be spontaneous or done in a few minutes now require extra time and planning to accomplish. Another mental illness that could develop is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD may make going back to their normal day to day lives very difficult.

Becuase there is no determined subject of the project, the students will have the rare chance to research whatever they want to.

Similarly to the style of projects, upon seeing all of the topics that interest the students, the teachers may be inclined to add some of the topics to their curriculum, which would once again encourage the students to be more interested in their classes.

When one student is interested in something, it is more than likely that other students will be the same.

Though it is important for students to work with topics that are already somewhat familiar to them, it's also very important for students to step outside of their comfort zone into something entirely new.

When a student begins learning about a topic with an open mind and a goal to learn, they may find more than a project, they may find a passion.

His favorite sport used to be football, until his classes started getting harder and he stopped playing. However, next year he is going to step down from one of his hard classes, so he can play football again and still keep his grades up; therefore, he will regain his much needed balance again.

Does the evidence demonstrate an impact to car companies? Did they have a financial deficit due to their lack of buyers? The answer is simple: no, because they didn't ban the use of cars. Also, car companies can well benefit from places that limit car usage but allow hybrid cars; this allows for an increase in revenue. Most car companies in today's society model hybrid cars that run on primarily electricity and gas.

While Venus is simple to see from the challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's perputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth; such an eveironment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.

If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some feartures that are analogous to those on Earth The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sych as valleys mountains, and creaters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,a crucial consideration given the long time farmes of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the optionsfor making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particulry compelling ideafor sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fary. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Striving to meet the Challenge presented by Venushas value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. our tarvels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

The big question here is, why humans never visited this planets in more l tha three decades. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, no since no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average oner 800 degrees Fathrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Also notable, Venus has the hottest sufrace temperature of any planet of solar system, wheather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes.

The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) has one particulary idea for sending humans to study Venus, Venus would aviod the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up andout of their way, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. No easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can.

Therefore, there is no one better fit to prepare the students than the teacher. ",Evidence,Effective
8851,fc842970b8ad,9F9FBC5BF6B3,"Through observation, it can be seen that the majority of the teen population does not stay ambitious or dedicated to school during the summer time. Due to this, it makes no sense why teachers would trust students to dedicate their time and effort into designing a well-thought out project instead of dismissing it so that they may enjoy their summer. Teens want to forget about school as summer time comes around, they do not want to spend it preparing for more school. For instance, if a student has the choice between an easy project or a truly helpful, but complicated and tedious project, observation shows that they are most likely to choose the easier option. Teachers should design the project because they would not be as tempted to simplify the project for the sake of their own self desires like students may. In the earlier situation, teachers would most likely choose the harder project because they know it would benefit the students in the long run. Since teachers would be more responsible and serious with the project, they are the ideal designers for it. ",Evidence,Effective
8852,bd0e3e44543a,9F9FBC5BF6B3,"For example, a highly detailed and extensive project would indicate a rigorous class. The projects are an opportunity for teachers to introduce and exemplify the expectations of the students---in this case, high expectations. This sneak peek into class life would hopefully prevent unpreparedness from students and help the class run more smoothly. Teacher-designed projects have also been shown to benefit students by preventing a switch of classes during the school year: a junior at Generic_School decides to switch out of her Spanish 5 class during the summer after attempting the summer assignment. If it were designed by the teacher, it would be just like assignments from the class itself. This demonstrates the advantage of having the opportunity to work on an assignment that mirrors the work done in a possible class: a student essentially gains the ability to do a test run to see if they like it or not. That junior would have gotten stuck in the class and performed poorly if it were not for the summer assignment. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers to give students an idea of what to expect and what is expected of them. ",Evidence,Effective
8853,be1671565fd7,9F9FBC5BF6B3,"Teachers are the best fit to design summer assignments for students because, unlike teens with only fun and relaxation on their minds who would not take the project seriously, teachers can create an assignment that will prepare the student for the specified curriculum and demonstrate what they expect from them.

This aspect is just as important to understand in the context of summer assignments. The majority of teacher created summer assignments are simply reading, whether that be chapters in a textbook or Shakespeare's plays. While this approach works quite well for some students, myself included, it is detrimental to the learning of others. It would be far better to give students an end goal of understanding to work towards, such as a presentation on the material at the beginning of the year, and let them create their own paths to understanding the content that they are supposed to be absorbing over this period. This would also go a long way to increase student engagement in the material, as students would be less likely to see this summer assignment as something of a chore, rather seeing it as a way to express themselves through the way that they learn.

When it came time to complete the AP US History summer assignment, he was out of his depth and did not understand how to properly outline the chapters that we had to read.

If students are able to take control of their summer learning, then they are more able to invest themselves into the content that they are learning as it will be something that truly interests them. What teachers should do is establish a baseline topic to understand by the end of the summer, such as the Revolutionary War and its causes, and allow students to research different aspects of this topic and give a presentation on their area of interest.

Every teacher is made differently; their way of presenting and showing materials differ. Therefore, teachers should make their own homework for the students. For example, if a student make a study guide for a test verses a teacher, who's will be more effective and useful? This is very obvious however, it clears up the air. Teachers make the classroom's atmosphere and lead the class to its maximum success. To expand, imagine if there were no teachers,only students teaching each other. Frankly, it would be chaotic and a disaster. The teachers are there to keep students in check and to create lesson plans and work for the students: to know how the well students are doing. Students do not check how well the teachers do because as students they receive the knowledge while the teachers pass it on to them.

11007,cc3bb929353c,C5EDEF3A8C35,"If the teacher sets an example such as the summer assignments, students can see what type of expectation that teacher and subject has for them.

For example, a student comes into AP Environmental Science with a bright colored poster, hardly any sentences and fill with visual diagrams, that student came in with a mindset of expecting that class was going to be visual filled, but in reality, they take notes and notes on end. However, if the teacher assigned to each student that they will be needing to watch a documentary and have notes filled out, every student will come in knowing the rigorousness of the class. If students were allowed to freestyle and choose their own assignment, the likelihood of them knowing the expectation of the class is close to nothing.

It could lead the students to more success to; if they are opened to new ideas and points of views, the student will learn more and be able to grow in knowledge rather than be stuck in the same perspective that they are in. For example, if a student was bias against the creation of country clubs and corporate made communities, but was to read about why those were created due to an assignment, he or she may have a shift in perspective and mind. This does not apply that he or she has changed their mind, but it has opened up their knowledge and gave them a fuller picture rather than it magnified.

Luke and his friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowboys program.

Another expense when attending a physical school are the school lunches which are priced from one to five dollars depending on the county or school system and can accumulate to an enormous amount of money for middle class students who eat school lunches everyday.

Online classes would allow students the ability to choose the time for their classes which forces students to practice prioritizing responsibilities and improve on their time management skill. An example of students who mostly work while attending school are college students who have to pay for their attendance and possibly even lodging within the college campus. Virtual classrooms would allow these students to build their work portfolio while also allowing students to return home after work and finish their academic assignments at home during nighttime. Another reason as to why online courses' flexible schedule is beneficial for students is because they would be able to have enough time during daylight hours to volunteer and help give back to their community which builds the morals and social connections with others in the community while also allowing the students to formally engage in academic studies at home after they've finished volunteering. Students would greatly benefit from online classes where a flexible schedule will allow students to have more time to engage in different experiences in life and formulate a more balanced lifestyle that isn't fully revolved around academics. ,Evidence,Effective

But most importantly, it allows students to have more independence which builds their character and further prepares them for the adult world where they are gradually gaining new responsibilities and experiences in life which they wouldn't be capable of experiencing without the flexible schedule that online courses allow.

Countless students are faced with circumstances that change every aspect of their learning experience, but we are now more able to counter these challenges than ever before. Despite the fact we have a long way to go to make sure students are given a perfect learning experience, problems associated with illness and moving could definitely be assisted with.

In these cases, the school day may only be seven hours, but a commute of up to ninety minutes in each direction can make school a time commitment of as much as ten hours every day, not to mention extracurricular activities that can take up even more time.

This is a serious burden on the daily lives of the students, especially with the need to complete homework and even just relax. Additionally, in some places, such as the Mid-Atlantic, one snowstorm of twenty inches or so can close schools for a week or more due to the lack of equipment to handle those occasional storms. This lost time can limit and hinder students' education simply because they are unable to get to school. Distance learning, so long as power is on, can heavily limit or even eliminate the impacts of such weather events or long commutes by taking away the commuting aspect of school so that the students can stick to the ideal schedule to maximize their education.

This leaves the quicker students bored and unsatisfied while the slower students are left to struggle to continue to catch up to the teacher's pace. This issue is especially prevalent in an AP or college level class, where there is a lot of material thrown at the students at once. With distance learning, however, students have the benefit of learning at their own pace. Because of the eternal availability of the internet and email as well as abundant resources both in virtual classrooms and on the web, students are able to quickly tackle the subjects that come easy to them while also able to slow down, ask questions, and get additional help on topics that they struggle on.

In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method. ",Evidence,Effective
18767,c98aa44822d5,3A3AD368D10E,"In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote. 
",Evidence,Effective
18768,78096e2a545d,3A3AD368D10E,"Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote. ",Evidence,Effective
18769,862f2ef111c3,3A3AD368D10E,"In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.         ",Concluding Statement,Effective

These group projects add the benefit of teaching students how to work with others in order to get certain tasks done, preparing them for when they have to inevitably work with other people they may not necessarily like. Online schooling is largely independent, and requires the student to rely on themselves and only themselves, while classroom settings teach both independence and dependence.

Online settings do not have this help accessible to their students all the time. Video conferencing may provide that needed assistance should a student need it, but students may feel uncomfortable asking for help as video conferences are typically done in masses; students who are all taking the course from home would be on the video call, and asking questions would require teachers to stop their lesson to re-explain a concept to everyone because one individual asked for help. In addition, video conferencing settings lacks the ability for that students to bond with the teacher, unlike classroom settings, which can increase their feelings of discomfort towards asking for help. An example of this lack of accessible help can be seen through loudoun vision, an online system which allows students to take their classes from home and online. Many students who take courses through vision feel an overwhelming anxiety about taking the class because they do not have a teacher accessible to them; they are expected to complete overwhelming amounts of work without the help of a physical teacher nearby. As a result, many students procrastinate doing the work, and are thus left with more anxiety about the class in general. Students who take vision courses complain about their teachers, who have a tendency to fail them as a result of doing an assignment wrong because they did not understand it.

Certainty Of  Outcome

Dispute over  the out come is possible-it happend in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute between popular vote. the reson is that winnning candidate's share of electoral collage invariably exeeds his share of the popular vote.

reason 2

:

Everyone's President

The electoral college  requirs canadates to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional such as Mitt Romneywas in the south,has so innocently favored for he gain electoral vote by increasing his plurality in those states and if done he know he'll win.

reason 3

:

Swing States

The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces  the canidates-as we saw in [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Voters in toss up states are more likeley to pay close attention to the campeign to really listen to the competeing canidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likeley to be on the most thoughtful votes, on average(and futher reason they will have recived the most information and attention from the canidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the one to decide the election.

reason 4

:

Big States

The electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmentof the senate decreed in the constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida [2012] never the less obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in woyming would net the winner got 3 electoral votes.

reason 5

:

Avoid Run-Off Elections

The electoral college avoids run-off elections wich no canindate recives a majority of the votes cast. For example , Nixion in 1968 and Clinton both had only 43% plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure,wichwould greatly complicate the presidential election processes.

However, with the rise of technology and the internet in the 21st century, students at most public schools are able to participate in learning both online and via video conferences, allowing them to effectively be educated from home. Distance learning in this way permits students to work on school subjects, even when away due being ill in some manner, and allows students with mental health disorders unable to attend classes the opportunity to achieve the same as someone attending school physically. Additionally, students working a job outside of school to support their family/self now have the opportunity to attend school from home/work and still be able to provide financial support to dependents/themselves.

Home-schooled students do not have the availability of a teacher to motivate them and make sure that they are doing their work. It is all up to them if they want to stay on task or fall behind. If no one is there telling the students what to do, they will struggle to find the motivation within themselves. As well as teachers, peers also help to encourage their fellow classmates to stay focused. This leads into the next topic of socialization. ",Evidence,Effective

Many long lasting relationships are established within a school environment. Home-schooled students cannot relate to in-school students in this sense. Not only is it important to form friendships, but it is also important to get comfortable around large crowds of people. Talking to people is an inevitable fate in everyone's life, this might be giving a presentation at work or publicly speaking in college. While it is a burden to most, starting earlier in life will provide more confidence for when you need it later in life. ",Evidence,Effective

25767,cb7976d4acba,99C687C4B554,"Another reason to argue for home-schooling is because of reduced stress. Some may say that the levels of stress will be greatly reduced in the comfort of home without the constant distraction of other students and the demands placed on students by teachers. While this partially might be true, more stress is caused when a student does not know how to manage their time wisely. Home-schooled students are at a greater risk for this because their are also many distractions at home such as cell phones and social media. ",Evidence,Effective

School teaches many important life values that teens will need for when they are an independent adult. Some of these values are impossible for home-schooled students to learn, simply because it is a different environment. Although the idea of home-schooling sounds like the most beneficial option, many people do not realize that home-schooled students have to face their own type of challenges that they will have to overcome. For these reasons I cannot stand for home-schooling. In this case, I will admit that old school beats new school. ",Concluding Statement,Effective

The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning.

They can still also do everything at home while they are sick if they would really like, since all of their materials is already with them on their computer. This way, the student will not fall behind in class, there is less stress, and they won't under perform on their exams because they are still able to learn the information they need on their laptop as usual. On the other hand, if a student is sick and cannot go to school that day, they miss all of their class papers and notes from that day and cannot usually make up what they missed. For this reason, online courses are a much safer and reliable way of learning that do not have the stress of missing a full day of information at school.

This way, students can complete projects on their own at home and they can stay focused on their tasks without the awkward feeling of having to worry about others at public school. Another strong quality of attending and completing an online course is that many online courses have fun and interactive lessons that keep a student engaged in the lesson, rather than sitting in a classroom and doing nothing because they are bored of the teaching or they are once again, just uncomfortable socially in a public setting. One on one online video conferencing is also easier for students to talk to their teachers if they need help because they may feel uneasy when speaking to a teacher or others in person. As a result, they also can learn things in an online course that they may not have ever learned if they were taking that certain course in a public school setting. ",Evidence,Effective

These simulations could include learning to complete a tax form or something of the sort that can be completed individually. Also, many English courses can be taken online and some teachers encourage it because many English classes are writing oriented, in which much of the class involves writing essays and research papers on a computer anyway. Therefore, just attending a course such as these at school can be extra work and a potential waste of a students time since it can all be self taught and completed at home online. Teachers specifically may prefer online courses a lot of the time because they do not want to repeat the same exact information to every single one of their class periods and that is usually self explanatory anyway. When courses are taken online at home, the teachers are able to structure the course into interactive courses that can be self taught and completed individually, so that the students can be more successful on their own, rather than taking up a lot of extra time that is unnecessary at a classroom in school.

In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winner-takes-all method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Run-off Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (3). I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

30786,0e8a90e3ce95,E09853233CCF,"First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country. ",Evidence,Adequate
30787,bf754e987110,E09853233CCF,"With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well. ",Evidence,Adequate
30788,0f69e4884d85,E09853233CCF,"In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able  to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.     ",Concluding Statement,Adequate

30790,13ee6e4c0fc8,E0A3FC64B7D3,"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Our state's entitled allotmeant of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for our Senators.

Each candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidiate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Most states have a ""Winner-take-all

"" system that awards al electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportional representation.""

What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the Presidential candidates themselves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Perhaps most worrying is the prospct of a tie in the electoral vote. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a President and ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the the President, nort the people. When you vote for a Presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Yet this has happened very rarely. It happend in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. There are 5

reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of Democratic pedigree

As humans, we tend to conform to the rest of society and value deeply what society has to say about us. Students self-esteem and self-efficacy go down when they don't understand a topic. Students tend to not want to be the outcast when it comes to not understanding a topic, so they just go ahead with a test, which results in them doing poorly on because not enough time was given to them.

Many employers like employees who don't depend on the employer for everything but can try and solve problems on their own first. For example, when working at a McDonalds drive-thru with a line full of people, the employee doesn't have time to be asking the employer a series of questions if a problem occurs.

Later in life, those online students are very aware of due dates and deadlines,for they have been accustomed to following them throughout their high school careers.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.

The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.

The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.           ",Evidence,Ineffective

He's dad had some good advice but the son want more advice like who do I get her to like me back so we went to get some more advice from is family.

The second week of school the son had had seen her again probably because she is in his class the day went on and on then the school day's over and the boy went home. Before the boy left the school a different girl came up to him but he rejected her and carried his day back home and told his dad what happened at school. the dad's son sawed his younger brother who is one year younger than him but he sawed him crying so he ask him what had happen at school and the brother told him.

So the brother told his younger brother that his girlfriend just broke up with him and said that the girl that ask you out was my girlfriend. None of this would have happened if you staid in your grade and stayed of moving up two grades and almost taking my girlfriend. The younger brother told that he said no to her and wanted a other girl but not her because he knew that his younger brother was dating her for the past few years. Three years later the brothers are in the same school but different grade the older brother is now one grade above than the younger brother and the younger brother got the girl he had a crush on.

when the two brothers got really old and they had to use wheel chairs to get where their going the brothers still had their girlfriends.

It can be hands-on help with the issue, guidance to another person that can help more, or even as simple as some encouraging words, any of those can help solve a problem. For example, person one goes to person two and says, ""Can you give me some advice on how to fix a flat tire on my car?"" Then person two gives some advice. Person one asks for help with it because he/she didnt'd understand, person two declines. Person one goes to person three and asks the same questions, person 3 gives different advice, but person one still doesn't understand, so they go to person four, and person four offers to help person one. Person one and person four fix the flat tire, and that couldn't have been achieved if person one had just given up when he/she didn't understand person two's advice. Basically, getting advice from multiple can lead to someone just offering help. ",Evidence,Effective
34203,4d6620485e3b,4A292725EE82,"If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.

So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, ""Person two, who are you voting for?"" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say.

34204,a3fc20b8c909,4A292725EE82,"This is beneficial because, of course, past experience with the problem can lead to better advice than advice from someone that has never faced the problem. For example, person one, once again, is having trouble with the cursed car, so person one goes to person two, person three, person four, person five, person six, and person seven. Person two, person three, and person five all give some advice that they found on the internet, person four offers to help but really doesn't know what he/she is doing. Person six just shrugs and says, ""I don't know what to do."" But person seven was a car mechanic for a few years, and person one didn't know that. So person seven not only gives advice that helps fix the car's current problem, he/she also fixes it to the point where it doesn't break down twice every week. The point is, if you go to multiple people for advice, chances are, you'll find someone with hands-on experience that can help you with the problem. ",Evidence,Effective

From fixing a car that can't seem to stay fixed to not knowing who to vote for, multiple people giving advice can help a lot. The President of the United States has the cabinet, which is a group of people dedicated to giving the president advice. So, if there's a big problem that needs to get solved and the advice of one person isn't working, try one more person, and if that doesn't work, one more, if that doesn't work, keep going until it does, because there's a high chance that someone can help with whatever the problem is, even if it isn't your inner circle of friends or colleagues, the advice that you need could be close by and you could never even realize it, it could be at multiple points nearby, and you could never even know that several people is what you're looking for.

They told me about the positives and negatives of it and compared it to other schools. It took me a while to make the decision, but I am glad I did.

Then, my mom reminded me that going to Colorado means I will have to stay with my grandmother, who may try to convince me to call my father. Lastly, one of my friends suggested I attend Generic_School because I will have friends going there and I will be given the chance to improve my art. In the end, I decided I would like to travel to Colorado. Even with the possible downside, Colorado is my favorite place and I would be happy to return again, as I have not been there in years.

The shy friend said to email her teacher telling her what my friend accidently did, the other friend said that she should wait until the teacher was back and talk to her in person. She did not think of emailing her teacher and explaining what happened. It is more likely she would have waited until her teacher was back and then not gotten full credit on her assignment.

Luckily, when you ask multiple people, and fact check all of their statements against one another, you can assure yourself a significantly smaller chance of obtaining false information.

These students, while they are oftentimes provided worksheets and assignments, are quite prone to falling behind in terms of the material. If they are not at school and at the lessons each and every day, it is extremely easy to lose awareness of the material being taught, especially if the only outlet for their learning is a packet of worksheets with practice problems. Without a teacher and peers, these students do not have access to immediate feedback on mistakes or teachers who are able to answer their questions. However, with distance learning, long-term home bound students would be able to work alongside their peers. They could engage in online activities and applications that would strengthen their knowledge of the material, while also allowing them to interact with their teacher and peers. Especially when it comes to video conferencing, students who cannot physically attend school would still be able to ask their teacher questions in person and potentially have private lessons.

With distance learning, a student who is well enough to work but contagious to their peers could still present a project, take a test, take notes on a lecture, and engage in class discussions all from home. It is unfair to limit a student's potential learning time based on things that they cannot control, like illnesses or travel.
