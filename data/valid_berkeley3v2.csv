719,15eb2902e184,0E67436136BE,so then you cheer them up and work to make things better you dont know it but you just saved a life because who knows weather or not that student was about to comit suicide or say someone was threatned and they will not tell you that so they act like there fine but you put the computer on them and it shows that they are scared now you know they are scared and can try to work with them to open up ,Evidence,Ineffective
720,302b5d8ce097,0E67436136BE,but from other people perspectives i can totally see how this is a total invading of privacy because we all have secrects and we dont want people knowing if were depressed or sad and alot of people dont like to communicate or open with anyone and also what if things get passed around about you being depressed the generatin today are bullys so i can see someone making fun of someone for being depressed. ,Counterclaim,Adequate

I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.

So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.

I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?

After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said "", Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor ""sleeping"". ",Evidence,Ineffective

For example, students could be assigned a project with no requirements where they have to make a presentation on anything that interests them, as long as there was a learning process.

This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.

I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.

Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.

Clearly cars are extremely harmful to the environment. However there is hope, because once car usage is limited these high numbers can be mitigated everywhere. In fact, in Paris, as Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune reported, policies to lower car usage have been taken and have actually worked! In France's capital ""motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" In hopes to reduce carbon emmissions and save the environment, Paris's prayers were answered as the smog cleared enough for the government to remove the ban for odd-numbered plates. Clearly, the pollution reduced due to one factor--limiting car usage. If actions around the world are initiated similar to Paris's plan, then a better environmental future is inevitable.

Limiting car usage provides this answer through a healthy lifestyle before this day arises. For example, In Bogota, Colombia, as Andrew Selsky from the Seattle Times put it: ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" had been built within Bogota after years of limiting cars. People are shifting their reliance on cars and turning them into productive means of transportation. In fact, rush hour restrictions cut traffic and has led to a rise in parks and shopping districts in Bogota, according to Mr Selsky. Even Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman in Bogota enthusiastically exclaimed: ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. However, Bogota is not the only place where limiting car usage has been gaining support, the Mobile World Congress has been engaged too!

The stress and frustration would continue, especially if a student cannot get approval. A student-designed project would require the student to present their project idea to the teacher for approval. Whereas a teacher-designed project would already be approved, eliminating the hassle of the first few steps in the project making process. For example, a high school student, Generic_Name, is going into an advanced science class. She has the idea to do a project where she will conduct a survey asking different people to pick their preferred flower from a list. The teacher denies her request because it does not reflect the class level. Generic_Name then has to go back and start from square one, frustrated and angry.

However, she is not sure if that is allowed, considering that the assignment was only on the president himself. She sends an email to her teacher and asks her question.

8606,3703b4ef8029,9BEB8A30BE1B,"In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author talks about a car-free town, Vauban, Germany. Because there are not cars, people are forced to use other forms of transportation. Instead of using cars, mothers and their children walk everywhere, people ride their bikes to the store, and a tram is used to go to downtown Freiburg. Another place where transportation has benefited from a car-free society, is Bogota, Columbia. According to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", written by Andrew Selsky, since car-free day began, bicycle and pedestrian-friendly areas have been improved. For example, since the 1990s, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built in Bogota. ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"", writes Selsky. Promotion of other transportation, such as walking, is just one of many benefits of limiting car usage. ",Evidence,Effective

By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, "" The End of Car Culture"", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.

This doesn't allow teachers to go over concepts from prior years. Making school projects student-designed will set up students for success because they have that prior knowledge to build off. When students retain information from the previous year, it gives them confidence when tackling new concepts. Schools try their best to give students confidence so they can perform to the best of their abilities.

When students enter school, they won't be confused when they start to learn because they already had practice on these concepts on the summer project. This makes academics much easier for students and allows them to have an understand even before the upcoming school year. Furthermore, if students are prepared for concepts learned for the next school year, it will remove the negative connotation that students have with school. Students often don't like school because it is challenging or they do not understand what is being taught.

This makes the transition into school difficult for students because they are used to having that time off. If school projects were student-based, students would have an easier transition into school because they would already be used to working during the summer. Keeping students busy during the summer will benefit their work habits when entering the school year. Furthermore, keeping students busy with summer projects will keep their brains working.

The facial expressions shows some emotional like happy , anger ect.

every day we have differnt caract or diferent emotional feeling and i don't know how Monna Lisa can be really intended tom bring a smile for us face. i thonk i cant recognize how my best friend feeling is just lokking her eyes cause i know her i and I know when she is happy, sad, bored, confusedand fear, I think people show the feelings but some people can's see because they don't care about it. I think that techonology is a great idea for us or some people who want to know feeling about some people important in their life. I think every emotional has one special moment sometimes are not special but its life and we can't do something abou it. Sonetines we have mixed of emotions like the Monna Lissa. She look happy but at the same time serious. Her smile look like different she can't smile like us. The reson of that is now she is just a painting. Leonardo da Vinci's paint the Monna Lisa but he die that the reason she doens't have the aye browns and thats why she sook serious. That is the reason she look like with different emotional feeling cause she don't have eye browns and she look likr that. we can see the movements in the people face and we can take an idea of how they are or how feeling and emotional are the face show everything. My conclussion is everyone have different emotional but if we want to know their feeling or emotional we need to stay with that person we need to meet the people spend time with him/her we can't say oh I need that techonology to see my wife feeling or my husband felling or a fried I mean is a good techonology but we need to spend time with the person the techonology can't do everything to us. We have the option let the techonology do that for us or do that for people if we really care about his feeling or emotional.

All thought these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth.

Also venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system. Even though mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcannoes powerful earthquakes are frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For an example some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II. Modern computers exidting in those days may sound schoking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

This reaction is due to the rigor of work school puts on students' backs and the repetition of constant learning. In order to give students time away, they are given three months of summer break which spans from June - August. During this time many kids choose not to continue learning and a negative effect of this is knowledge and memory decay. In order for their minds to be stimulized and conditioned to learn once school begins, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. ",Lead,Effective

10719,1f7d6bac401e,BFC824D7C408,"Being able to do something which one is passionate about results in the best work that he/she can produce, this is because learning is driven by motivation. When a teacher assigns something for the student to do, he/she does not have an eagerness to learn because of the fact that it is something they don't have a strong passion for. When students are given an opportunity to produce their own projects, their minds open up and they begin to think outside of the box, which results in true creativity. School is based on a set curriculum and students have no input on what they learn and how they learn it, as a result, students lack effort and motivation to learn. Giving students an opportunity to create will eventually lead to increased productivity in later life One example of this is when adulthood hits and students are required to develop a skill set. Students are never given the opportunity to learn individually and this causes students to become dependent on others to feed them knowledge and information, therefore, students will only learn when they are demanded to. Having the freedom to create will give students their best opportunity to learn, whereas when they are not able to design certain projects, their goal shifts from learning to completing which will result in the content not actually being analyzed and took in.

10721,d9d00e93e07f,BFC824D7C408,"Students become boxed in boundaries due to the pressure of doing things a certain way and learning the way teachers tell them to. When students can design projects and learn in a way they believe is beneficial, learning becomes less of pressured task and more of a way to explore one's horizon. One thing students struggle with the most when completing assignments and projects is constant pressure. Students do not have the ability to express their ideas because they have to stick to an exact rubric. One of example of this is a science expo; many teachers tell the students what they should do for the project and don't give the students time to think about what interests them. This pressure of another voice constantly in their head makes learning and expression of ideas a struggle. In order for students to reach their full potential, they should be able to design in a way they are not boxed by others. ",Evidence,Effective

Thinking outside the box and being able to express ideas is very important, however, without teachers, students would have no path of what to learn and how to learn it because they do not have the experience and accumulated knowledge many teachers have. Teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to the students ability to learn during the summer because the content would be structured in way which is taught during the school year. An example of this is when a science teacher assigns a cell packet project which corresponds to the cell unit taught during school. This might be very boring for a student to learn, but doing this project will set the student up for success when school begins. If the student were to design their own project it would probably not be in line with the certain style of teaching which will cause the student to struggle during the school year. The main focus of teachers is to help students succeed in school and by designing these projects students will be able on the correct path to fulfilling that goal.

Being able to acquire knowledge and learn in way which interests one self is very important throughout his/her life, however there are different goals for both the student and a teacher. The teacher's goal is to help the student succeed in a certain class, whereas the students goal is to learn what they want in a way which interests them.

The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations.

Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus.

This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus.

A teacher is able to access what is necessary to learn before the class starts and they will be able to create a project that is nothing but beneficial. In my own past experiences the summer projects have never been very difficult but they have required a small amount of my time and energy. When these projects were spread out I was able to complete them well and they helped me. I have never had a project assigned to me over the summer months that was necessarily difficult and I have never received a large amount of them at the same time.

A project that is designed by a student may not properly prepare you for the rigor of the curriculum that is to come or the amount of time that is necessary for the class. A teacher creating a project will be able to demonstrate how much time the student will need to put in for their class in the upcoming year.

It was sort of like being thrown into the deep end of a pool before ever learning how to swim.

In the past the summer assignments that I have been given have not been too difficult and I never really minded doing them. The teacher is the one who teaches the class and if they expect us to have prior knowledge of the class then they should be the ones designing it.

Also, as you may know already, most of the student body retains a C average. Your change in school policy would mean that everybody who is currently participating in school activities would be kicked out of them until new term grades come in at which point they may only hope that they did well enough to continue their sport. Our competitive would all fail do to the almost complete rooting of the students. Now this may only last a term, but who knows how long it might take to raise your grade average by a whole letter? You obviously went to school when you were a child, and I assume you enjoyed the extra curricular clubs which your school had to offer. Now imagine this. Imagine that you learned that you had to maintain an A or B average to continue in these sports. Now this was one of the years where you didn't do so well, and therefore got a C average.

The students who had improved their average would join their respective clubs but the students who had not would be forced to withdraw from their activities. The sports teams would fail because every player they got with the new term would not be as practised as the ones which they had from the old term. And what if their all-star line-up could not retain the necessary grade point average? Then victory for our sports teams would almost be impossible. I do not doubt the skills of the students within our school, but skill given and skill learned are to different things to consider. A person who is not great at basketball but who goes to every practice and tries as hard as he can at home might as well match a natural-born super star at basketball who doesn't practice due to arrogance.

The electoral collage is a process, not a place. The electoral collage process consists of the selection of the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral of the electoral votes by congress. The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The Congressional delegation one for each member in the house of representives plus two for senators. The 23rd Amendment of the constiton the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral collage. Each candiddate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party but state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by political party. The state law vary on how the electors are selected and their responsibilities. The presindential election are held every four years. After the president election the governor prepares a Certifiate of Ascertainment.

Source 2; The indefensible electoral college; why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong.

Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. If you live in Texas and vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electores pledged to kerry would get 34 electoral votes. On the off-chance that those electora won the statewide election they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 votes. The single best argument against the electoral collage is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people are lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest eleection crsis in a century. Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with the new electors who would oppose John F Kenney. He was a great learder.

The number collage is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democrtic in a modern sense. When you vote for a president candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are five reasons for reatining the Elctoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree all are practical reason not liberal or conservative reason. In 2012 election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes.

This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. The disaster factor is the single best argument against the electoral college. I agree that most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidate don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidate at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. I agree that the it's official that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best agruments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The Senate would choose the vice-president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters,would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.

Take Romney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winner-take-all"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair.

If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school.

Recording lectures encourages these students to pursue academic enrichment outside of the classroom as they do not have to worry as much about catching up on classes.

It will decrease in mental health issues but it also allows for more time to be spent with the people they love and care about, which in turn builds their mental health up.

Google cars have driven over half a million miles without a crash. google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor.

Companies are already, and have already, been making these computer driven cars. As an example, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Google made the modified Toyota Prius, and BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

These, ""driverless"" cars are not really driverless. Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless carb to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. The Google Cars must have an alert driver when driving. The Google Car cannot pull in and out of driveways. When dealing with road contrustion or navigating through an accident, the driver must take over then as well. The BMW, ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" can reach speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.

Not even ten years later, those same sensors had become so advanced as to now provide drivers with the added safety of a car who could respond to the danger of out-of-control skidding. Furthermore, by the 2000s, radars that at one point had costed millions, could be found in your regular old run-of-the-mill car for your local dealer ship, ready for the purchase of any regular civillian.

As time has progress, so has technology up to the point where it surpasses human intelligence and reaction speed, and in the case of these new cars, would make it generally safer for the extremely accurate computers to do the driving, rather than humans, who would make a great many more faults when it comes to driving safely and accurately ",Evidence,Effective

Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate"".

This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

The founding father established it in the constitition as the compromise between election of the President by a popular vote. The electoral college cobsists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the house of representatives plus two for your senators. Each candiate running for president in your state has hin or her own group of electors. The Electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President  because when you vote for your candidate  you actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certifacte of Ascertainent"" lsiting all of the candidates  who ran for president in your state along  with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state  at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. Your state's certificates of acertainments are sent to the congres and the national archives as part of the official records of the presential election.

Under the electoral college system, voters not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas, for example, and and wanted to vote for john kerry, you'd vote for a slate of democatic  electors pledged to kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors?

While he may be able to get more sleep at night, Generic_Name has not established a routine for his school work, so he wastes hours before and in between classes.

Learning from home usually requires students to take all of their tests online rather than on paper, which becomes problematic when there is no teacher or reliable adult proctoring the administration.

At home, students are not monitored regularly as they are at school, which is a breeding ground for incomplete lessons and assignments. Subsequently, grades plummet, and in many cases, so does the motivation to excel. In order for education to fulfill its purpose, students should attend school in a building separate from their home.

I have seen both my mind and confidence expand outward in new ways ever since I began my studies, and that has enriched my life in an incredibly impactful way. Similarly, online schooling and partial self-education could give countless students that same pride in their abilities and dedication to their studies that it gave me. When told that only one place will serve as their primary source of learning and then associating that place with the direct, critical judgment of others on their skills, students, ironically, don't learn much other than to doubt both themselves and the system that supposedly embodies study. If instead those same students were to be given the same information but driven to seek out more knowledge for themselves and schedule their everyday life around learning, life would become an enthralling adventure to prove one's worth to themselves and to investigate and marvel at the expansive body of knowledge surrounding one everywhere.

By introducing students to this kind of learning, online schooling, on the students' end, helps to both de-stress students about college and get them invested in their own education. Many claim to know complex answers concerning the root of today's educational crisis, but there really is one easy fix- make students care about what they're doing and feel comfortable with it, and more students will find success and contentment in adult life.

Not giving the student the chance to receive their high school diploma through online classes is only setting he/she up for failure later in life with little job opportunities and an overall lesser quality of life. If the student were to attend online classes from home, however, their condition would not be triggered due to them being in the comfort of their home and not in a public space, which is a usual trigger for most people, and they would receive an education. Some could argue that providing online classes to students with mental illnesses will only fuel their condition and that it is catering to a budding sense of entitlement, but that is very inaccurate in almost all cases. To force a student that is clearly suffering to go to school is not only cruel, but it also makes the student feel as if they do not matter and that their feelings are invalid.

For example, I remember encountering a situation as a fifth grader where I had to choose between saving my money or buying a new gaming system.

I had been saving this money since fourth grade, and I had accumulated more than four hundred dollars.

When I went over to my cousin's house, I was able to play on his gaming system, and I thought it was really fun.

Before I left, I made sure to ask him if I should invest in the same gaming system or to save the money.

His response was to buy the system.

Even though I got the advice I needed, I made sure to ask other people the same question.

Next, I remember asking my parents if it would be worth it.

My mom had told me that we already had lots of video games.

On the other hand, my dad told me that it was my money, and if this is what I decided to spend is on, it was completely fine.

After seeking multiple points of view, I had finally made my decision.

I was going to buy the gaming system.

To this day, I still play on that console, and I do not regret my investment.

After asking many people, you start to see a pattern in answers.

In my case, I figured out that the majority of people I asked said it was a good idea to buy the console, ",Evidence,Effective

Ultimately, that was a big factor that told me I should buy the console.

If you ask many people the same question and you get the same answer, whatever they are telling you is probably the smart and correct thing to do.

It may not necessarily be the decision you were thinking of making, but it may be one to consider.

Back at the beginning of the school year, my English teacher assigned our class a project where we have to make a difference in our community.

At first, my idea was to organize a community-wide sports equipment drive.

When I got home that day, I discussed my idea with my parents, and they told me that was not the best idea, and that we should sit down and discuss a better idea.

I decided I wanted to prove them wrong.

Fast forward a couple of months, and I am struggling to get anything done on the project.

That night, I told my parents that my idea would not work, and they just gave me that ""I-told-you-so"" look.

From there, we devised a plan where I would instead help the volunteers on the Blue Ridge Parkway.

Right now, my project is going great, and I am close to crossing the finish line of completion.

From that, I learned that you need to take advice of others because, in my case, my parents knew what they were talking about.

If multiple people tell you that something is not the right choice, then you should probably reconsider.

That was a life lesson I needed to learn, but from seeking advice from more than one person, you learn many life lessons.

From asking people for advice, you can learn may valuable things that will assist you.

Not only do these decisions affect a singular situation, but they can be applied to life very easily.

Now, if I am interested in purchasing anything, I always weigh the options, and ask others what the best thing to do would be.

I learned that skill from asking people for advice.

If you had only asked one person, they could have told you to take your grandfather, dog, cousin, son, etc.

Instead, asking many people gave you a better grasp on the situation, ultimately allowing you to determine the best choice is to take your brother.

Asking many people for advice before making a decision is a good choice because you can examine other people's opinions on the situation, figure out what the best choice is by finding the most common answer, and learn many life lessons.

If you are asking for advice - don't pick your favorite person.

Don't get me wrong, I love looking at adorable picture of babies. But during the year, I lost my love for history and never thought about being a historian since.

Therefore, students learn how to correctly interact with others, and build good relationships. However if a student is taking classes online, they wouldn't be obligated to actually communicate with peers in person. Having the ability to talk to others is a very important skill for their working careers in the future. During a career you will be forced to interact with many people such as, co-workers, costumers, and clients. Therefore, attending school is a great way to obtain those skills by talking to other students and their teachers. Furthermore, It is also a great way to build friendships with kids their age. Having friends can change the overall experience to a childhood because it can lead to a life necessity called ""fun"". Life wouldn't be the same if I didn't have people that I could call my friend because learning can be more interesting if you're experiencing it with people you know and trust. Lastly when a student can build relationships with their teachers, not only does it give you an easier learning environment, but it also provides an adult that you can ask questions or talk to. I have good relationships with many of my teachers, therefore allowing me to have a great experience in school. I am able to go to them if I ever need something or if I'm confused about a certain topic. Relationships with teachers can also ""make or break"" your experiences in your classes. When you look up to your teacher, it's more likely for you to want to learn what they are teaching because you have respect for them.

This being said, if you are used to working at your own pace and on your own time, you will not be prepared to be in the working environment. Unfortunately, this can lead to the loss of your job and other opportunities because you can be considered unreliable. Furthermore if a student is used to working in a quiet area in their home, they can be at risk of not knowing how to handle busy and loud work environments. This can restrain them from being able to complete any of their work, therefore making them insufficient. When a place of business gets extremely busy, a lot of stress can be put on the employees. Attending school allows a person to be introduced to those types of conditions at an early stage, therefore making you more prepared for them than students who take online classes.

Many students experience this chain reaction, therefore causing a lot of stress that can lead them to giving up. Having the access to attending a school decreases the ability to start this chain reaction because facing a teacher due to you not completing your work can be intimidating. Furthermore, going to your classes in person also gives you more work motivation because most of time you don't have the option to sit around and do nothing. Your teachers encourage you to ""use your time wisely"" when you are given the opportunity to complete your assignments during class, therefore giving students the extra push to actually do their work. When students are able to work on their own schedule due to taking online classes, it opens the opportunity to be lazy and not complete school work.
