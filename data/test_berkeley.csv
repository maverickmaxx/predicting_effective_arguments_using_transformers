554,46f58858850a,0BF9F64D6FD1,"Students across all age groups look forward to the last day of school, the day summer vacation begins. From the endless memories summer entails, to the exciting, fun experiences, summer vacation is one of the most beneficial times for students. For many high school students, teachers assign summer assignments or projects that relate to a class they may be taking in the upcoming school year. These assignments tend to require an expansive amount of time and also tend to be rather ineffective. In the summer students want to fill their time with exciting activities that they would enjoy.

The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work.

Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today. Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for.

2380,2fab8fb6257f,2BC448B88B54,"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.

The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth."" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.

This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.

Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien momument after all.

While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia. They just do not pass the face very often.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.

They used the cameras highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Garvin.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."" He added.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.

The end of car culture has hit everywhere and id just getting to the U.S.

President Obama's goal to curb the United states' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient  shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewwer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. the essential question is "" Has America passed peak driving?""

the United states had been long one of the worlds prime car cultures. But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after. As of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995.

""different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and policy center. She cites various factors about how the internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet your friends. the renewal of centercities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexable commuting arrangements, inncluding the evolution of shared va services for getting to work.

a study last year found that driving by young peopple decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 and even car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

As a Elisabeth Rosenthal from the New York Times expounded: ""Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Clearly cars are extremely harmful to the environment. However there is hope, because once car usage is limited these high numbers can be mitigated everywhere. In fact, in Paris, as Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune reported, policies to lower car usage have been taken and have actually worked! In France's capital ""motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" In hopes to reduce carbon emmissions and save the environment, Paris's prayers were answered as the smog cleared enough for the government to remove the ban for odd-numbered plates. Clearly, the pollution reduced due to one factor--limiting car usage. If actions around the world are initiated similar to Paris's plan, then a better environmental future is inevitable. The environmental benefits of reducing car usage are endless. After all we only have one planet, cars should not be the machines to dictate our environmental future. ",Evidence,Effective

Limiting car usage provides this answer through a healthy lifestyle before this day arises. For example, In Bogota, Colombia, as Andrew Selsky from the Seattle Times put it: ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" had been built within Bogota after years of limiting cars. People are shifting their reliance on cars and turning them into productive means of transportation. In fact, rush hour restrictions cut traffic and has led to a rise in parks and shopping districts in Bogota, according to Mr Selsky. Even Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman in Bogota enthusiastically exclaimed: ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. However, Bogota is not the only place where limiting car usage has been gaining support, the Mobile World Congress has been engaged too! Bill Ford, the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out his plan where he envisioned a ""world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesriable,"" (Rosenthal). He believed that ""partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety"" (Rosenthal). If people around the globe are willing to support this movement, especially a chairman for one of the world's largest automotive companies, and partake in this new lifestyle, then limiting car usage must be the way to go.

Diesel engines make up 67 percent of cars in France, which is much higher than their European counterparts. Compared to other captials, Paris has a much higher particulate matter as well. It had over 30 more micrograms than the next highest, which is Brussels, mostly due to the cold nights and warm days, which would trap carbon.

12600,34c224d6e81b,E36560297AD9,"Teachers have lots of experience with helping students create summer projects, therefore, should be the people who organize them. While the work may seem tedious and difficult at times, teachers are simply just trying to assist in helping you gain the knowledge and understand it. By giving students a lot of work, teachers are helping them learn not only the information being attained from the project but also, how to manage their time efficiently. Teachers understand that when students are working in a time frame, they have a better understanding of how to manage their time to work efficiently and get everything done before the due date. Experienced teachers can guide students in how to manage their time, get everything done, and still have time to spare. It is because of experienced teachers that students have been able to construct outstanding summer projects. ",Evidence,Effective
12601,4bf56e6133b3,E36560297AD9,"If a student is engaged, they are more likely to succeed. Teachers engage students by designing summer projects in a way that interests them. A student who is engaged in their project is more likely to receive a good grade than a student who showed no interest in it at all. Teachers typically try to stick to things that inspire all students equally, they try not to lean towards a specific influence as to remain unbiased. Students have many different interests which is why student-organized projects would be beneficial. A teacher with a good understanding of their student's likes and dislikes can better organize a project that will help students be engaged. Keeping students engaged is a difficult, but manageable, task and while not every teacher can do it, they all try. ",Evidence,Effective
12602,0e4d522468cd,E36560297AD9,"Challenges can motivate students into working their hardest and trying their best. While some may argue that challenging work actually causes students to be less inclined to do summer projects, it actually motivates them more. Statistics show that students who are challenged receive better grades than those who are not. If students were to organize a summer project, they would more than likely leave out any form of a challenge, students would much rather have free time than work on a summer project and that would lead to students designing an easy summer project that requires little effort. Teachers on the other hand, give students lots of work so they can gain the information in a much better way. Summer projects aren't made to take up all your free time, they are made to make sure the information that was being taught during school actually stuck and that students fully understand it. Teachers who challenge their students are the teachers with the highest passing scores. 
",Evidence,Effective
12603,371417fc292e,E36560297AD9,"Teachers can organize a summer project better than students because they are highly experienced in doing so. Teachers find ways to engage and challenge their students which leads to a higher passing rate. So while student-designed projects can be fun and easy, it's more effective when summer projects are teacher-designed. The biggest problem with teacher-designed projects is that not every teacher or student is the same, However teacher-designed projects are said to be more successful than student-designed projects. They are not always fun, but they are always effective. Teachers are always working to help students gain information and be successful in life. So next time you have a summer project and you want it to be student-designed, think about all the things your teachers do to make sure you are going to be successful. It isn't supposed to be easy, and it isn't always going to be fun, but as long as you learn the information, it will always be beneficial. ",Concluding Statement,Effective

Many schools offer online services to accommodate those who vary in schedules, need more time for assignments and comprehension, or even those who just work better alone.

For example, a student may not understand a concept in math and want to try and fully understand the concept before being tested on it. In schools currently, many students are being forced to take tests having not have comprehended the topic of study. This also leads to the problem of social influence on a students learning. As humans, we tend to conform to the rest of society and value deeply what society has to say about us. Students self-esteem and self-efficacy go down when they don't understand a topic. Students tend to not want to be the outcast when it comes to not understanding a topic, so they just go ahead with a test, which results in them doing poorly on because not enough time was given to them. Online school provides this option, so a student is not given a test before they thoroughly understand the concept ",Evidence,Effective

Students feel free to take breaks and not be restricted to the overcrowded rooms that are common in regular schools. It's also proven that surroundings have an effect on mood and willingness to learn. If the atmosphere of a classroom is sad, depressing, or gloomy, then students may have a gloomy or depressing attitude when in that class, hindering them from learning at their fullest potentials. With online schools, the student chooses their place of study and knows what places motivate them to create high quality work and retain the most information. ",Evidence,Effective

Sometimes students will have to figure out the concept themselves which develops their problem-solving skills. The independence and problem-solving skills can become useful later on when the student applies for a job. Many employers like employees who don't depend on the employer for everything but can try and solve problems on their own first. For example, when working at a McDonalds drive-thru with a line full of people, the employee doesn't have time to be asking the employer a series of questions if a problem occurs. Instead, the employee must find quick solutions and learn independence. The employee won't learn unless they try it. ",Evidence,Effective

Students still need to write papers in online school, but the only difference is there is no teacher to remind you of the due date and pressure you to complete it. Later in life, those online students are very aware of due dates and deadlines,for they have been accustomed to following them throughout their high school careers. Employers like employees who are punctual and have tasks or assignments done on time. This idea of time management also prepares the student for college if they choose to go to an actual college or university. Professors like assignments done on time and also won't give too many frequent reminders on when those assignments are due. Professors also like when students take accountability for their actions.

This can cause the person seeking advice to ask other people what they think, just to be safe. If somebody asks other people the same question and gets a different response, they may value the second or third person's opinions, rather than the opinion coming from the first person they asked. For example, when going to get seen by a doctor for an injury, people may have multiple consultations for treatment, then choose which treatment plan best suits them. Therefore, having multiple valued opinions can help somebody make a decision that fits the situation, but also fits that person's own needs.

A lot of times, the thought process of the people that are lying is more along the lines of trying to be kind and respectful, rather than giving a fully honest opinion. Although some people might not tell the truth, others most likely will, if asked. Since honesty is a key component of trust, honesty is valued far more in rough situations, than just being nice.

33615,2edccab8c4eb,2A4C1A1AD665,"If somebody asked only one person their opinion, it would be impossible to get a group's majority. As mentioned in the second paragraph, a majority of people can bring far more reassurance than one person. This can help somebody make better decisions, since there are other people that have examined the situation as their own, and have given thought out advice. As well, it is often a good feeling to somebody, knowing that multiple people acknowledge and care about them. People like when they have not been lied to, because it shows a relationship of trust. Trust can play a big factor, in terms of advice, because a person will not be able to believe other people's ideas, if they can't rely on the person. In conclusion, asking a group of people for advice can lead to different recommendations, an increased sense of relief, and ultimately, making better decisions. At the end of the day, it is important to ask others for advice because people have to make their own decisions. Sometimes it can be extremely hard for people to decide which path to take.

Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision.

So as you can tell after reading this finding more opinions is very helpful and could change your life in some ways. However this does not mean that every first opinion you get is wrong it just means that it dose not hurt to have multiple opinions to choose from. Like I said in sports and In basically anything in life it helps because you will always have choices to make and getting more opinions might just come up big for you. After going over my essay of why you should get multiple opinions then I hope you consider seeking more than one opinion next time you need an opinion on something.     ",Concluding Statement,Effective

I'm never going to fit in here.

One of the eyes turned away from me and began to speak. She formed strange sounds with her mouth in a language that wasn't familiar to me. I turned around and ran out of the room, feeling so alone, so deserted. Salty tears stained my cheeks.

A week ago, I had taken a 14 hour long flight from

Generic_City to Generic_City. It was my first time being somewhere else other than my home country, and I felt so intimidated by the new environment. Strange shapes, strange sounds, and strange people with impossibly bright hair and piercing eyes surrounded me. It was all beautiful to me - but at the same time, the most horrifying thing I'd ever seen. I felt trapped in a haze. This haze was brimming with thoughts of never fitting in, never adapting to these alien surroundings, and mostly - the crushing feeling of homesickness.

This haze pushed me down into a deep cavern, and I was encapsulated by darkness. Even though my parents tried to find me in this cavern, every search effort was in vain, until something miraculous happened. An angel, perhaps, entered the deep labyrinth and ushered me out. Her name was Ms. Generic_Name. She gave me a new perspective, a new bias. Ms. Generic_Name told me to view this unfamiliar atmosphere as something special, a new opportunity - not a hostile monster trying to swallow me whole. She told me to be glad of the change in my life. This was the first time I had ever listened to somebody's opinion and savored it in my heart. I didn't know the importance of listening to the viewpoints of others at the time. I thought

I always knew what was best; after all, nobody knew me better than myself. I took her words and used them as fuel for learning English and making friends. I thought her words were all I needed, but somehow, I was still in despair. I still struggled. So - I decided to let someone else tell me what they thought was best.

After school, I talked with my parents. I told them what I felt, that I was always alone. That I felt so, so homesick. They told me it was good to feel that way. Moving overseas was a tough thing to endure, and they said it was healthy to let myself feel down sometimes. They told me I didn't always need to pretend I was happy when I was not. These two opinions from Ms. Generic_Name and my parents shaped me as a person - I learned to let people in, and know that seeking multiple opinions is a wise thing to do. Because of this, I learned to speak English and surround myself with a group of compassionate, kind friends who guided me through my darkest times. I learned to let in my parents and take notice that they always wanted what was best for me. I learned that I didn't always know what was best, and that was okay. ",Lead,Effective
