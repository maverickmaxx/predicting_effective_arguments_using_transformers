It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable.

This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details. It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts. On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take. As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from both sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other.

Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.

Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.

By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences.

2380,2fab8fb6257f,2BC448B88B54,"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.

The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth."" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.

This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.

Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien momument after all.

While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia. They just do not pass the face very often.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.

They used the cameras highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Garvin.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."" He added.

4503,1a173caf3df4,50122C17BAD4,Today I'm writing about The Challenge of Exploring Venus. ,Lead,Ineffective
4504,3fba466a3c68,50122C17BAD4,"Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". Its one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

First, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we expreinced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather presnt additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of Venus.

Last, NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.

If students don't get into these clubs or feel as though they aren't going to be able to do anything with these highly competitive clubs, they drop out and find themselves having nothing to do outside of school. Many students feel defeated and neglected after they don't do well in these clubs and find it hard to join any other club, for fear that the same tale may happen again.

With the various advantages of creating this policy and minor drawbacks, each school should at least make an attempt to enact a policy that would not only help students but the school as a whole. With students having the added motivation to join the clubs offered at their schools, with the added diversity to the school, there is no reason a school should make an attempt to complete a policy like this.

Bales of hay and bages of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. And then he had to clen the Stalls.

On his second trip Luke had to served his night as a watchman. His job was to check on the animal every hour.

5943,bea6b0b2fde4,6C3B801F92D2,"people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", she writes, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with even-numbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with odd-numbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with odd-numbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one. ",Evidence,Effective

The changes are a direct result of the city's Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year. It reads, ""It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"".  These additions are in response to the city's inhabitants using alternative transport. Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means. Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely. Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay ""In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars"". She writes, ""While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs"". One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway. Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores. This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending.

Extracurricular activities, while not solely responsible for this, are a large factor that affects how a student performs in the classroom. For example, Model United Nations is one activity which teaches students about various useful skills, like public speaking. Students stand up in front of the entire class giving a speech, sometimes off the top of their head, on a certain problem affecting the intense world today. Model UN is not only a useful educational tool, however, as it is also capable of helping students think about the world with a new perspective. Many topics given are about finding better solutions to certain issues prevalent in today's world. Students come out of this club brimming with new ideas, self-confidence, and a will to learn. Sports are another activity beneficial to students. They learn skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and even get better sleep at night.

College is a big part of life not just in the United States, but all over the world. By going to college, one can get a better education and in turn, a better job.

Students also need a hook that make them stand out from the others in the eyes of the university. In fact, some colleges have given out scholarships to students for extracurricular activities. For example, playing a musical instrument, like the piano. Not only does this help with how a student does in the classroom, but colleges also look for students with musical talents and even partner with music schools for this purpose.

7309,bd8f50bc865e,84DB11599420,"when I was in 6th grade I had a summer project of choosing an influential president and explaining what that president did for the country. At the time, I was interested in science instead of history. As a result, this project seemed lackluster and an arduous task to complete over my summer break. However, if I had been given the opportunity to choose a topic that interests me, I would have found the summer project exponentially more exciting and something to look forward to. Many students feel the same way about this, as they wish to choose the topic they will research and create a solution to. Therefore, it is evident that summer projects should be student-designed so that students can have a genuine interest in the project they are completing. ",Evidence,Effective
7310,a2e65b28fba9,84DB11599420,"Time and time again summer projects are dreaded by students and a task that many do not look forward to. As a result, students are left unhappy during summer break in regards to completing a project their teacher designed. This is either because the project has limitations, is about an uninteresting topic, or is difficult to complete. These factors can leave students feeling demoralized from completing their summer project and can make summer break a dreary time. Despite these conditions that come with teacher-designed projects, these problems can be solved with student-designed projects. When given the chance to explore what interests you and choosing whether any limitations exist regarding your project, inevitably students are inclined to complete summer projects. From the perspective of a student, you have more motivation to work on a self-designed project. This increased motivation correlates to an increase in mental health. When regarding this benefit, summer projects should be student-designed. ",Evidence,Effective

That is why students look forward to summer break. As a result, schools should not contribute in reversing the association students make between summer break and enjoyment by assigning teacher-designed projects. With the intention of continual learning occurring over summer break, schools should allow projects to be student-designed. It gives students the chance to explore their passions and make new discoveries without any limitations. Teacher-designed projects only serve in holding students back from doing projects that truly hold meaning to them. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the most logical decision schools can make is having summer projects that are student-designed. This will allow students to have a good time in both the academic and non-academic part of their summer break.  ",Concluding Statement,Effective

Once the smog cleared enough, the ban was lifted and citizens were allowed back to the road, but the reduction of auto usage was what saved the air from becoming overly polluted.

This is the new technolody that the author wanted to used to find the humans emotions, , and see which one of the two option that they had can be more easy or more faster to find the human emotions.

My other example that also i found in this article is when said that ""according to the new computers softward can recogniza emotion. The softward is the least innovation from Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Backman institute for advanced science at the University Illions."" The author is trying to tell us to describes the new tecnology was little complicated because with he wanted to describe that technology to see if will be more easy to identify the emotions. Also in this article said that the process begings when the computer construct a 3D computer of the face, all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. That why i think that describes that new techology wasn't eassy because the new technology need to identify all about human. ",Evidence,Ineffective

In the text it says, "" to help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)"" UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys"".

The Seagoing Cowboys are people to help take care of the horses, young cow, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke had been traveling with food supplies for the aniamals and that people need. On Luke second trip he served as a night watchman, his job was to check the animals every hour. Being a sea going cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke. It opened up the world for him. Luke was glad that he was able to help other people from other countries to help when World War II ended. He was also glad to help take care of these animals so they can still live.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky.

The twon offers a tram that runs through the downtown, and a few small streets on one edge of the community. The town cannot bain cars altogether, but if you own a car the only place to store it is in large garages at the edge of the town. One space can cost $40,000, the cost of the space comes with the home. Only 70 percent of the population in Freiburg owns a car and 57 percent sold there vehicle before moving. Germany isn't the only country with this type of movement. The United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. This will cause increase demand of public transport to the suburbs surrounding big cities such as Chicago and New York.

Paris, however, is the first city to prohibit driving altogether. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drribing ban to clear the air of the global city. Drivers where asked to leave their cars at home or risk a fine of 22 -euro ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers where fined. Diesel fuel was blamed becuase France has a tax policy which promotes diesel fuel. Almost 70% of drives have diesel vehicles. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions where made for hybrids and electric vehicles.

13269,03de0e67b265,EEC9540E73FD,"In fact, according to a study performed by Harvard University, almost 85 percent of students participate in after school activities that take up more than 8 hours of time per week. This would include practicing the activity and for many activities you would have to compete. For example, one of my friends, Generic_Name, does many activities. She plays on a competitive lacrosse team, she plays a musical instrument, and she takes all honor classes. She barely finishes all of her homework, and she has stupendous time management skills. If she had to take part in another after school activity, she wouldn't have time to do it all. Because kids do other things, if you made them partake in a new activity they would also become a lot more stressed. ",Evidence,Effective
13270,36f1ceee6271,EEC9540E73FD,"If you make them participate in another activity, that will make their stress levels go up and could possibly push them over the edge. It's obvious that students won't have the best time management skills because they are kids. Since they don't have these skills, they will end up being stressed about completing their work. In a survey I compiled with seventh and eighth graders at my middle school, I discovered that a whopping 94 percent of students considered themselves stressed. 76 percent even went as far to say that they are overly stressed. This puts into perspective how students are already very stressed without the excess activities. Personally, I partake in a travel volleyball team, a musical instrument, all honor classes, I make sure that I study enough and do all of my homework, and I make time to spend maximum amounts of time with my family and friends as possible. I manage to finish all of this, but many days I do not get much sleep. On most week days I get about 6 hours and the recommended amount of sleep for a thirteen year old is about 8. It can get very tough to finish all of my tasks I have to complete in one day. I know that if my school made me participate in another extracurricular activity I would not be able to complete all of this work I previously had to finish. And obviously school would be my top priority to complete, so I would possibly have to drop some of my hobbies and interests that I love. Another reason we shouldn't enforce this rule is that many kids that the school is forcing to do the activity probably won't enjoy it. ",Evidence,Effective
13271,dc5599f73c93,EEC9540E73FD,"The main extracurricular activities that people partake at my school are plays and clubs where you can compete in, such as Model United Nations, debate club, Science Olympiad, and many others. At my school with over 1,000 students, only about 100 decide to join these clubs. These clubs only appeal to certain people that enjoy academics. If you're interested in things related to sports, my school does not have much to offer for you. When my sister was in middle school, about 7 years ago, they had very few clubs. They had 3 official clubs. Our mom made her choose a club to participate in. All that she could choose from was debate club, chess club, and homework club.

She had little to no interest in doing any of these clubs that she thought were boring and dumb. She ended up doing chess club, but she ended up hating it immensely. She said that everyone was better than her and she didn't even know how to play. This all happened because she was forced to pick an activity from three, horrible sounding, activities. This all would not have happened if no one had made her do an activity she despised. The same thing will end up happening to many children if the schools make them participate in activities they don't wish to do. Kids doing something that they don't want to do will end up with them being unhappy, which will end up in a negative learning environment. ",Evidence,Effective

In the end, this will benefit basically nobody, because if someone really needed or wanted to participate in extra activities, they could without having to affect every person other than themselves in the school. Many would be upset with this new plan, so I believe that it would be best to keep our system the same. ",Concluding Statement,Adequate

As much as it is said the actions of those in power do not show it. School is supposed to be a safe space but in reality it is not. There are people who take everything that life gives them and use it as motivation and they thrive. Others are not there yet in life as students are children. The education we are gifted with is a blessing. However sometimes the people in the building are the issue. Going to school for 9 months carrying a child is very hard. Kids can be more brutal than adults. Having the ability to take your classes online at home will benefit so many children in the school system. ",Evidence,Effective

Students distractions will be limited. The environment will be safer. It is sometimes necessary for students to take online classes at home therefore it should always be an option. The big picture is to make our next leading generation more educated than the last. Whatever makes that easier should be employed into our school systems.  ,Concluding Statement,Effective

This is basically shows that ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" This means that no region such as south,northwest,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The third resone to keeping these methods is Swing States. This tells me that its the ""winner takes all method."" The fourth method why we should keep these methods is the Big States. This explains that ""the Electoral College restores some of the wieght in the political balance."" this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage. THe bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do. The final reason why we should keep this method of voting is Avoid Run-Off Elections.

The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Companies figured since they couldn't make the road smarter they would make the cars smarter. Manufacturers such as Google with the modified Toyota Prius uses lots of sensors, video cameras, radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. Also a Dubbed LIDAR is used to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the vehicles surroundings using laser beams.

In the 1980's automakers used speed sensors on the wheels for the creation of antilock brakes. Although sensors are not new creations the sensors on ""driveless cars"" tell the car when to slow down, speed up, or even stop. Companies plan on improving these sensors to make driving ""safer"" and so that the cars can actually become ""driveless"". As none of the ""driveless"" cars produced so far are not actually ""driveless"" but still require ""driver assistance"". Meaning the driver can't just sit back and relax they have to stay alert and be ready to take over if something should happen. GM has developed seat ""notifications"" that tell the driver when they are backing into an object. These seats vibrate to alert the driver of the objects behind them.

Some manufacturers plan on bringing information systems such as ""heads-up displays"". These information systems can be turned off as soon as the driver needs to take over. Automakers continue to work to solve the current problems with ""driveless"" cars. In some states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars.

18251,b4514e0e0ba8,346D40A69BBF,"The Electoral College is a process, consider a place. Our founding fathers established it in the our country`s Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by voting in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The process of the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors. They vote for th President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state`s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia(DC) is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own electors group.

The electors generally are chosen by the candidate`s political party, but the states laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, you help help choose your state`s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate`s electors. Than after the presidential election, your governor prepared a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascetainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will resprent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.

18979,43384384f054,3D7740BCAA23,"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.  With majority of 270 votes are needed so there is a good chance of getting a fair shot to win.  Each candidate running for president in a state has to have there own group of electors which eguals out the odds.  The electors are chosen by the candidates political party.  In most states they have a winner takes all system but Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportion.

The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidate in the state and shows which electors will be representing your state at the metting of the electors which helps us to know who had won the presidental election.  Voting for a state election of who will turn elected for president. When voting you would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors to pledge for Kerry.

Voting for a president is like voting for a state elector.  Even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it has only happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.  The reason is that the winning candidate shares the Electoral College invariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote.  The Electoral college requires an apresidental candidate to have transregional appeal.

The residents of the other religions are likely to feel disenfranchised and that their votes does not count and that the new president will have know regard for their interests.  That he is not really there president.  The winner of all methods of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates like as seen in the election of 2012.  They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on average and that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate as the most thoughful voter should be the one to decide the election.

The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constituion.  Having the electoral College avoids the problem of electiong in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potental voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example or Republicans in California.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.  As some would say the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  The best arguments in favor of it are most likely assertions without much basis in reality.     ",Evidence,Ineffective

Working from home brings in a couple essential factors, that a lot of times are hard to find at schools which range from comfort, focus, and familiarity. One basic aspect that is often pointed to when talking about comfort at school versus comfort at home is the amount of noise pollution. While at school, you are often surrounded by twenty five to thirty other students who are all chatting and creating noise pollution in your work environment. However, while working at home, there is rarely any noise pollution because of the vastly lesser amount of people in your work environment.

Once they understood the circumstances, parents and students started to have questions; ""how will the students continue getting their education?"", ""what format will it be in?"", and ""how will it be administered?"" The response that most school counties developed for these questions was long distance learning. Distance learning is a new format of teaching where students stay at their homes while completing assignments; but, this method of learning has gotten somewhat controversial.

The issue lies within the ""spoon fed"" mentality that develops in a work space such as this; a work space entirely devoid of any personal initiative. Never mind don't, when adolescents can't take the initiative for things that deeply benefits them, they will inevitably feel as if they are just a hamster running on a wheel, or just another gear in a clock, causing for a lot of procrastination or laziness; the stripping of self initiative develops a feeling of diminished importance in ones self leading to less attentiveness and over all less care for the subjects being learned.

These smart road systems worked well but require massive upgrades to existiing roads , which is simply too expensive. So with out the smart roads a whole lot of sensors are needed on the car , one specific sensor is the special touch sensor which makes sure that the driver keeps their hands on the wheel at all times . Besides that there is also seats that viberate to alert the driver and flashing lights on the window shields , which would add on to the price of a car. Also stated in the passage that so far none of the cars are completely driverless.

This means the human driver must be alert and ready to take over at all time.

Which brings up the case of a drivers, passengers , and pedestrians saftey , and lawmakers know that saftey is best achieved with alert drivers , which is stated in the passage.

22479,81c735cda3ee,6C30C0076FAD,"""Knowledge is power,"" the esteemed Francis Bacon once said. Those words, repeated verbatim for ages, are the foundation of education, for as long as education serves to teach and inspire. However, there is an arising problem where students are unable to focus on their schooling due to external factors such as holding jobs or taking care of their families. This phenomenon causes harm to the future academic aspirations of these students and is wholly detrimental to their education. As per federal law, all children in the United States, from the ages of five to eighteen, are legally required to attend school. However, for those students who must serve a purpose other than studying, having to spend hours of their day at a physical school can actually severely affect their ability in both educational and non-educational pursuits. Although this situation may seem dire, there exists a surprisingly simple solution that can adequately meet all the needs of these students: distance learning. Distance learning is a program by which students are afforded the option of doing their coursework from home by taking online courses. By providing a feasible alternative to traditional schooling, distance learning will allow students to do better in all facets of their lives. ",Lead,Effective

In a 2016 study published by Psychology Today, it was found that the stress level of students had risen nearly 15% since 2012. This, in tandem with the fact that many high school students work part-time or even full-time jobs on the side is the exact reason why distance learning must be implemented: schedule flexibility. If students are able to shape their educational schedules to meet their unique independent needs, then the mental health of those students would doubtlessly improve. In fact, in a TED talk about a similar brand of tutelage entitled ""hack schooling"", it was discussed how the alternative method allowed for students to feel more secure about their learning as it was being done on their own terms. This means that if students are allowed the chance to shape their education to suit themselves, they are then able to comprehend the information that they learn rather than simply memorize and regurgitate it. ",Evidence,Effective
22484,10b2a18a5b9c,6C30C0076FAD,"By removing unnecessarily strenuous factors such as the long hours and rigidity of traditional schooling, distance learning provides an avenue by which students of all backgrounds and situations are afforded the opportunity to thrive. ",Claim,Effective

Between fixed bell schedules and assigned bathroom breaks and a plethora of functional rigidity, independence is rather unfortunately not a trait that is bred well in traditional American schools. However, as students grow to become adults with much more autonomy than is allowed in said schools, this dependency can become malignant to the development of their own psyches. Giving students the ability to attend a distance learning program is something that can, in turn, teach students to become more independent and self-reliant. Between managing their own time, finishing their coursework, and learning to use their online resources wisely, students will gain a learning curve which will lead them to be vastly more independent than they would have been in a traditional school setting. Take, for example, students who complete online courses via the Generic_School program in the Generic_City school district. In the form to apply for courses, students are asked how they demonstrate independence and ability to manage their coursework. As distance learning demands more in terms of organization than traditional schooling does, it is clearly vital for students to be, or at least to learn to be, more independent. ",Evidence,Effective

By encouraging independence, distance learning empowers students to learn discipline and organization in addition to traditional academia. Knowledge is indeed power, and with the knowledge that educators have about distance learning, they must now enable students to experience first hand how distance learning can benefit them.

24261,9a12597fe741,84AD2A5BF53E,"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college process consits of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes byCongress. The Electoral College consits of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for thePresident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows much worse. Considering thst the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, end that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy wouldn't have actually gone to Kennedy.)

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

Now, the concept is beginning to come to fruition due to the advanced technology created. The most important bit of technology on the driverless car is the spinning sensor on the roof, also known as the LIDAR. The LIDAR is able ""to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" Without the LIDAR, the accuracy of the driverless car would be greatly reduced as the car would have no sense of its surroundings. Another technology that was greatly enhanced is the antilock brakes. In the 1980s, the antilock brakes ""used speed sensors at the wheels"" to monitor when the car was becoming out of control. Back then, the antilock brakes only had a sensor to monitor the wheel's speed. Now, the antilock brakes have become more advanced to the point that they are able to ""detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" The antilock brakes have evolved from only having a sensor that monitors speed to sensors that can detect many dangerous conditions. The advancement of car technology greatly affects how safe and successful a driverless car may be. A driverless car would most likely not be able to work in the 1980s with the speed sensor as the antilock brakes.

This concept of passing over the responsibility of driving makes the driverless car very safe. As long as there is an alert driver within the car, the car is almost certainly not going to make any accidents. Car developers designed the driverless car to ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" Thus, the car will do most of the driving and when there is a difficult situation, the human driver will take over. This ensure the utmost safety of the driver and the passengers as there is an extremely low risk of an accident occuring. There are ""driver's seats that vibrate"" and the Google car even ""announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This increases the safety of the driverless car as the driver will be notified when to take over.

In an online setting however, students would be restricted to communicating with their teachers through messaging or email. In that scenario, it would be hard for teachers to explain student's questions due to their inability to provide a visual demonstration. Also, students may be in the risk of experiencing loneliness due to the lack of social interaction. Students make most of their friends through school, and by having an online classroom with no face to face interactions, they're missing out on all the friends and memories they could've made.

Last year in my AP Biology class, we frequently did labs, which helped me learn the material a lot better than the lectures did. An example would be when we dissected an embryo of a pig, in which I was able to gain a better understanding of anatomy and parts of the body. Group projects also widened my understanding of topics in other classes as well. When we had to use a three dimensional printer to copy the outline of a roman column, a type of architecture, I was able to better understand the designs and features involved in the creation of this type of structure. Online classes wouldn't be able to provide the same opportunity because it would be impossible to perform regulated science labs and complex projects in a household setting.

Universities often have classroom settings for their lectures, and students will not be used to it if they have been studying from home for their high school years. A classroom setting and a household setting are two completely different experiences. It would be difficult for someone to get used to a classroom setting after they've spent years without even stepping into a classroom. Another disadvantage is that they may find participating in group work to be difficult. Many college assignments involve projects or group work, and distance learning students would likely not be able to perform as well in those assignments than as students who attended regular school. For example, it may be hard for them to follow the directions and meet the requirements for the project, as well as being able to interact and make agreements with their group members. Furthermore, group work is also critical in jobs outside of college, so this applies to students not attending college as well.

This can cause the person seeking advice to ask other people what they think, just to be safe. If somebody asks other people the same question and gets a different response, they may value the second or third person's opinions, rather than the opinion coming from the first person they asked. For example, when going to get seen by a doctor for an injury, people may have multiple consultations for treatment, then choose which treatment plan best suits them.

Most students who are not super passionate about school would much likelier not pay attention in an online class, or not even attend altogether.

Whatever the reason may be, social communication is a very important skill to have; and while this skill may come easy to some, for us introverts it can be a rather daunting task. As a child I was very shy and tended to cling towards my mother at any social event I would attend in order to avoid the other children. My mother never forced me to, so I saw nothing wrong with staying by her side instead as it is what I was comfortable with. It wasn't until my first year of grade school that I would be pushed into interacting with others without the sight of my mother. I had spent so many years avoiding others that I found it very difficult to be social with other kids. By the time Middle School came however, I had gotten quite use to being around other children and could present myself properly in a social space. However other students did not have that luxury. As the sixth grade started, I was introduced the first home schooled child I had ever seen. Due to her being home schooled, she didn't spend much time with other kids her own age. Because of this, she often didn't relate well to others and could never pick up on normal social ques. As the years went on and she continued to be taught in public school, she did in fact become a lot more social and gained a group of very close friends, myself included, but the point still stands that if either of us had stayed to ourselves and had never been put into a social environment at that young age, then we would've never learned how to properly conduct ourselves in society.

For example, Generic_Name's options were to be single and discontinue the use of the dating app, or meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship.

For example, my brother, who is now a senior in college, participated in a system similar to distance learning while he was in school. After having participated in online and video conferencing classes for almost all of his school career, he had a much harder time adjusting to the college style of teaching than the other students, from his same high school, that did not participate in distance learning. Another way that distance learning would not help students prepare for the set up of college is that the students that participate in distance learning will have trouble adjusting to having to leave their house to attend class. In college classes are not offered inside of dorms and students will have to travel outside of their living area. If students do not practice taking classes outside of their home in high school they may feel uncomfortable learning in an unfamiliar environment and that could affect their learning abilities when they get to college.

If students were to participate in distance learning, although they would meet various other peers through activities like sports, clubs, or their hobbies, they would not meet as many people as they would if they were also in a classroom with twenty to thirty other kids. Because of this limited interaction with other kids their age, these students who participate in distance learning may not learn how to interact and collaborate with other students. For example, my brother had a difficult time making friends in college because he had little experience interacting with other children that he didn't already know and have a relationship with. He also struggled in group projects because he had not participated in one since elementary school, when he began distance learning. Not learning how to collaborate with others can be detrimental for a student because that will be a major part of their lives after they finish school. Whether they use the skill of interacting with other people in their future job, or even just to make to new friends after moving to a new town, the skill of interacting with others is very valuable and important to possess.

However if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because their is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside of a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also their is less distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching a six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I would have completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade.

I hadn't thought of that because usually, everyone runs all the events just to give each team a better chance at the fastest time. So decided to leave early for my friend's party. I ended up winning the mile event, and then having a great time at my friend's party.

Only really intelligent people get into Generic_School, and I wasn't sure if I had a good enough chance of getting in. I focused mostly on whether or not I was going to make it in, and if the probability of me getting in was worth the effort. When I asked my dad for advice he said ""do you even want to go to Generic_School?""

36689,479fb02ae14b,FD05FDCEA11B,"My footsteps seemed impossibly loud as I walked into the classroom, and it felt as if everyone was watching me. I glanced around, taking in the unfamiliar eyes staring me down.

I'm never going to fit in here.

One of the eyes turned away from me and began to speak. She formed strange sounds with her mouth in a language that wasn't familiar to me. I turned around and ran out of the room, feeling so alone, so deserted. Salty tears stained my cheeks.

A week ago, I had taken a 14 hour long flight from

Generic_City to Generic_City. It was my first time being somewhere else other than my home country, and I felt so intimidated by the new environment. Strange shapes, strange sounds, and strange people with impossibly bright hair and piercing eyes surrounded me. It was all beautiful to me - but at the same time, the most horrifying thing I'd ever seen. I felt trapped in a haze. This haze was brimming with thoughts of never fitting in, never adapting to these alien surroundings, and mostly - the crushing feeling of homesickness.

This haze pushed me down into a deep cavern, and I was encapsulated by darkness. Even though my parents tried to find me in this cavern, every search effort was in vain, until something miraculous happened. An angel, perhaps, entered the deep labyrinth and ushered me out. Her name was Ms. Generic_Name. She gave me a new perspective, a new bias. Ms. Generic_Name told me to view this unfamiliar atmosphere as something special, a new opportunity - not a hostile monster trying to swallow me whole. She told me to be glad of the change in my life. This was the first time I had ever listened to somebody's opinion and savored it in my heart. I didn't know the importance of listening to the viewpoints of others at the time. I thought

I always knew what was best; after all, nobody knew me better than myself. I took her words and used them as fuel for learning English and making friends. I thought her words were all I needed, but somehow, I was still in despair. I still struggled. So - I decided to let someone else tell me what they thought was best.

After school, I talked with my parents. I told them what I felt, that I was always alone. That I felt so, so homesick. They told me it was good to feel that way. Moving overseas was a tough thing to endure, and they said it was healthy to let myself feel down sometimes. They told me I didn't always need to pretend I was happy when I was not. These two opinions from Ms. Generic_Name and my parents shaped me as a person - I learned to let people in, and know that seeking multiple opinions is a wise thing to do. Because of this, I learned to speak English and surround myself with a group of compassionate, kind friends who guided me through my darkest times. I learned to let in my parents and take notice that they always wanted what was best for me. I learned that I didn't always know what was best, and that was okay. ",Lead,Effective
