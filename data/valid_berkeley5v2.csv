Speaking of competition, if the project would also have an incentive to try to achieve the best project, students would even be more thrilled. The student-designed project will show a big amount of their own ability to the assignment and make them strive for the number one spot. This would heighten the accomplishment of the project and give them a sense of excitement for their own unique project to compete with classmates. In the end, rather than having a normal boring project, students who have a chance to design their own project, will have a lot more fun and excitement in the process of doing the project, in which, will still allow them to learn and not interrupt with their fun and relaxing summer break.

Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned.

They keep students tethered to reality and are reminders that the beginning of school is nigh. They are helpful because they keep students' brains used to learning and working over the summer in order to make the start of the new year less painful.

So, perhaps the teacher would assign work on the basic topics of chemistry, namely what an atom is and what the parts are, the periodic table, nomenclature, and simple chemical reactions. By doing so, students begin the school year with knowledge that can allow them to grasp the later curriculum with more speed and ease. Summer projects are perfect for setting the foundation for the school year, laying the ground upon which the building of knowledge can rise.

On the other hand, a teacher may prefer lectures, hands on learning, or visual learning. A summer project could match the teachers style of teaching, providing a proper introduction to the school year.

They become interested in both the project and the relevant part of the curriculum. Applying the information you learned in previous school year is an excellent way to test what you've learned - and applying it to something you genuinely care about is the best test of your understanding. Also, people must be interested in a project before they can be enthusiastic (or willing at the least) to engage with the it, and everyone knows that engagement is a good thing for learning. Students incorporating something into their break makes them even more likely to do it, a fact that has had especially important bearing for me this last year, where it's been challenging to stay on top of the workload. The few times I've taken some days off to relax, I noticed that it was comparatively really difficult to get myself to do stuff when starting again. I feel even more apprehensive if I get out of the habit entirely. It's simple: when you give a student a break, they're more likely to engage in school projects if they feels like a part of their break, so not only does letting students design their own projects provide quality, but quantity. Here's an example which fits perfectly with what I'm saying: I walked into my History of the Americas class at the beginning of the year, and many of my peers who were top students had not finished reading the books they were assigned during the summer and fudged the details on the accompanying paper. When listening to them, the most common remarks were about how dry and uninteresting the prescribed book list was and how having to do it in the summer was an annoyance that they just wanted to put off. Meanwhile, most student-designed projects I know of provide much better learning and motivation. The biggest example I've in my mind when writing this is my experience with the I'm in the IB program, where students are required to complete an

Extended Essay, a 16 - 20 page paper on a subject of your choice.

And, even if students make it slightly easier, it is still reflective the curriculum - and in the long run it's that knowledge that matters, especially later in life. Likewise, if students can put it off for a month or so, that isn't really a bad thing. Spacing, or leaving what learning and then coming back to it right when you're almost forgetting it, is one of the most scientifically backed learning techniques we know of. In one study, students were asked to memorize words in Spanish, but split into multiple groups.

Yes, kids might cram it in the week before break ends, but remember that most kids already do that. It's fair to say that student-designed projects are a win for learning, creativity, teachers, and students alike that we're missing out on.

Student-designed projects both prepare students better for the next year while helping them consolidate what they've learned previously better than most teacher made assignment ever could, with few exceptions.

For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth.

A teen gets to talk to others near their age group who started out just being part of a crowd, but because they met them while playing the part of Juliet, they turned into a best friend. Additionally, we get to help the whole state while having a incredible time.

By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus.

If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started.

Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive. But he couldnt work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Luke also found time to have fun and he got to play volleyball, table tennis,boxing and fencing but this happend after they unloaded the animals then they got to have fun and enjoy their time.

However, this did not bother my teacher because her goal was to get us used to doing research projects before we went to middle school. While it may have seemed as if we, the students, were designing out own project, we were really doing the teacher designed project of practicing research. Another time, in tenth grade chemistry, our teacher told us for the end of year project to do whatever we wanted. She never specified that it had to relate to chemistry, even though it was implied. So when it came time to present our projects, a group of boys went up to the front of the class and started explaining the rules of spikeball. When asked what spikeball had to do with chemistry they said they did not know the project had to be related to chemistry.

If he had given us a project designed by him over the summer I would have been more prepared for the first real projects of the year. On the other hand, my ninth grade English teacher gave us a summer reading project of her own creation that really helped at the beginning of the year. By completing that assignment, I was prepared for the year because the reading got me used to the workload of the class, and the project got me ready for future similar reading projects that we did every month.

Counting By 7s , the main character excells at history. Although she excells in that subject, she has trouble with other subjects. A teacher-designed summer project for her may be focused on math and writing while her student-designed project would have been based on history, which may help her retain that knowledge, but does not help her with subjects she truly needs practice with. In addition, teacher-designed summer projects can have students learn new material that will be used in the upcoming school year. Teachers are aware of what will be taught in a course next whereas students are not. These summer projects would allow students to prepare ahead of time for the school year by reaffirming previous knowledge and learning new information directed towards the course. Many educational resources are only for teacher use or are not accessible to students prior to the school year, such as syallbuses and requirements for a course, Khan Academy, and other study sites, allowing teachers to be more effective in designing summer projects than students.

Teachers are guides and resources for students to follow when learning information and asking questions. Frederick Douglass, a slave in the 1800s, became self-educated by looking at other students' papers and reading magazines and books. Although he helped himself become more knowledgable about the world through the new information he obtained, he learned some information wrong because he was not guided or corrected by teachers. Student-designed projects can be precarious because teachers cannot correct students if the project is designed inccorectly. If the project were teacher-designed, then the correct information will be present and learned by the students. The summer projects being flawed can also hurt students. By learning the information incorrectly, they are likely to repeat the same mistakes, making it harder to correct them. In the book

Fish in a Tree , a girl with dyslexia struggled with writing because the words kept moving. She got into the habit of writing letters a specific way so that when a teacher noticed and corrected her, it was hard for her to stop the habit of writing letters incorrectly. Student-designed projects can give students the freedom to express their creativity through learning and designing, but this also allows for students to do their project incorrectly because they learned the material wrong, leading them to repeat the same mistakes because the teacher is not aware of how the students are designing their projects.

Students can manipulate student-designed summer projects by creating a project that is not difficult to do, therefore not pushing or challenging them to learn new information. One example of this was demonstrated by a study of a homeschooled family in the Midwest. The parents gave their children the freedom of designing their own cirriculum for education based on their interests. Instead of centering their cirriculum and challenging themselves with subjects like algebra or chemistry, they studied games and did not necessarily learn anything.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's armosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures averga over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet.

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furhermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames os space travel.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularle compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

More impotantntly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas, or anyrhing else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.

NASA is working on other aproaches to studying Venus, For example, some simplified electronics the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.

To allow students the chance to dictate their own project gives them empowerment to extend curiosity and discovery to outside the classroom. Having done project based learning in school, I can undoubtedly state that the monotonous nature of school deprives students our freedom to learn without restrictions.

Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this car-free community when she states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal). By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual car-free day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the car-free day is ""a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Selsky).

In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars: ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Chicago Tribune). To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically.

10476,ac086cb3110c,BBDD46456082,Venus is different from Earth but it is the same in some way. It is differnt because of the tempurature and the atmosphere and the surface. The tempurature reaches up to 800 degrees fahrenheit and that is unsurvivable for humans. The surface is bad to it is a hot lava and molten like suface and it can melt most metals. Venuses atmosphere is mainly filled with 97 percent of carbon dioxide. The air pressure is really bad it is strong enough it could crush a submarine like its going down to the deepest part of our oceans. NASA is trying to come up with a way to study Venus with a blimp like vehicle that can float 30 miles up away from Venus and its nasty surface and atmosphere.

Giving kids these potential interests can help impact their choices in life, such as what they want to do for a job or what they want to do for a hobby. People might already have their future planned, but joining an extracurricular activity can change their views and can give them new ideas.

Furthermore, fencing also requires a 14 meter strip as well as extra room so other students will not get hit by any stray blades.

Frankenstein in English, but after having to write so much about it I no longer like it and don't really remember much of what happened.

Even if a subject is interesting, the desire to do a project on it can be crushed by the formatting of the project.

With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a ""winner-take-all"" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was.

(Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born. ",Evidence,Effective

""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" (Posner 21). This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, majority of 270 electoral vote, is to elect the President. Each state is entitled allotment in its Congressional delegation which means one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors and are treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.

The Electoral College system has a method called ""winner- take-all that awards all the electors to the winning presidental candidate.

Workplace skills are also extremely important skills one can lack when attending classes from home. An educational institution progressively trains students with these skills, for they are necessary in order to succeed in performing well or getting a job.

After long days of school at home, your eyes can start to irritate and become red, meaning the body may want a break. Online school, however, doesn't give the eyes the rest they need to function at maximum capacity, causing health problems in the long run. The technology needed for online conferencing can also ruin a student's ability to sleep well. Technology can be addicting and can keep students awake for long periods of time without rest. If students are attending online school for a few hours a day, use their phone for another few hours, and potentially engage in any other screen, they can lose sleep. Getting enough sleep for normal schooling is already a problem, so online school may not have the ability to fix that problem. The home is a comfort zone for everybody, but it can lead to a strict mental mindset. It doesn't allow people to grow to their fullest potential because they're at home most of the day, isolated from the rest of the world. One only grows by way of leaving your comfort zone, trying out new things, and going to other places.

Most Americans who are eligable to vote have full-time jobs, full-time school, or are busy in some other aspects of life. These people do not have the time to vote for our president becuase they are working at the time, most work one or two jobs at the least, leaving little time for social graces and time alone, let alone time to vote. One other reason citizens dont vote is just hte sheer fact that they are lazy. A good precetage of Americans just do not care about who our president is or who runs for office, thus not voting out of sheer laziness. ",Evidence,Ineffective

The latest case of this happening was for the ban on gay marrige. Most voters voted in favor of the ban due a passage in the bible that stated that man shall not lay with another man as he lays with a woman, even though there is a homosexual couple in the bible, mathew/mathius something. The story aout a man named Dave and another named John, if i remember correctly, one of them said ""your love exceeds that of a woman"" or something close to that. There are a number of testiments that say not to judge others or to love everyone, but most focus on the one against those. Baising your vote on spiritual beliefs does not help anyone and is unfair towards those whos lifes you are negativly affecting. We should all think logically when voting for our leaders, and ask questions like 'who will this affect' 'how will this improve apon the lifes of my fellow Americans' 'will this improve our dilapitiating economy and crippling structe of the government' along with other questions that relate to how this canidate will improve apon the country as a whole.

We, the people, should all live together in this country, equaly, as one, not letting our beliefs negativly affect the lives of others. We should be able to practice what we want, when we want, without having to be fearful that others might punish us baised on what they practice.

That being said the only way for students to feel that way is by sending them to school. Even though the idea of being able to attend classes from home sounds really good it will not help you prepare.

26900,d66f7197d507,A8411CE08C68,"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of Representatives and plus two for your senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. When we vote this way, there's a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Ellectoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constistution.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. In the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated  like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.

The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportion representation"".

Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.

Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.

The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people.

This fear of being unable to attend school and still keeping up with their course load is one that plagues many students. Personally speaking, I can reference numerous students who have felt dangerously ill on school days, but were so afraid of missing tests and presentations that they still came. They felt that if they even missed one day, they would have missed salient lessons, causing their work to pile up, resulting in stress. Providing an alternate method for these students to learn, such as online classes, would have mitigated their concerns. This logic pertains to mental health as well. It is common knowledge that the mental health of adolescents in this generation is declining, and the most prominent reason is school. Online classes provide an avenue for students who feel their mental health is worsening to still receive an education but from a place of comfort, which is their home. ",Evidence,Effective

29631,abb786eb2947,CF43485AE351,"Students are forced to learn in classrooms with another 20-30 students. Some students have trouble concentrating with so many of their peers present. There will be less people at a time in online classes, so they can learn better and acquire a better grasp on concepts, as there are less distracting factors. The primary benefit, however, is for students with social anxiety, those who feel intimidated by the presence of others, which is more common than one might think. Those who say social anxiety can be reduced by being around large quantities of people at a time do not understand the mechanisms of anxiety. Sometimes time is the best remedy; being forced to indulge in conversation with their peers will only be an obstacle to students with anxiety-related issues. This obstruction is eliminated in distance learning. ",Evidence,Effective
29632,4fcc0734807c,CF43485AE351,"Furthermore, though the specific details of online school have not been listed, such as the duration of classes, it can be assumed that class length will be dependent upon the student. ",Claim,Effective
29633,b68556a88190,CF43485AE351,"For example, if a student's schedule is comprised of Algebra II, Biology, US History, and English Language and Composition, if the student is strong in math, he or she will likely speed through the course, allotting more time to the other subjects. If the online classes are based upon pace, students can get through subjects quicker, rather than being forced to remain in a class for an hour and a half. This results in students having more time to engage in the activities they are passionate about while having more flexible schedules. Why is this significant? Well, for example, places like INOVA have volunteer programs for kids to help senior citizens that require people to work from 12 pm-3 pm on weekdays. A regular student could not possibly participate in that program, regardless of how passionate he or she is about helping the elderly. Alternatively, if a student had an idea for a groundbreaking research project that he or she must complete in a lab, the student could devote more time to developing their procedure and collecting data than before. Attending school in person, regularly, will likely be an obstacle for these students, as a nearly 8 hour long school day with four hours of homework and mandatory extracurriculars does not leave sufficient time for the students to pursue their dreams ",Evidence,Effective

Permitting students to attend classes from home has a variety of advantages. Among those, the most evident ones are that students can focus more of their time on their passions, learn better, and preserve their health without concern of missing class. Schools are meant to be a place where students can grow by obtaining knowledge and applying it. Whether classes are online or in-person should not matter greatly (though online may actually be more helpful), as the outcome of an education will remain the same.

The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place.

The question of who is legally to blame for issues would waste time and money. During the process of development, the producers are accepting accidents as a given fact instead of trying to produce a flawless car. They are also focusing on the idea of a ""entertaining car"" instead of one that keeps the passengers alert for possible accidents.

You decide to ask your mom and she said to make sure you walk the puppy and make sure it gets enough exercise because it is a big dog. Then when you go get a check-up for the puppy you ask the vet and they say to make sure the puppy gets enough food, exercise, and water. Of course you go with what the vet said and now your puppy is the best looking dog in the whole apartment building. ",Evidence,Effective

I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any ones feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it.

I could easily tell this was overwhelming my sister and stressing her out a lot.

As children with developing brains, staying on task with all of these factors can only be accomplished by a few, but not the majority. A study conducted by the University of Virginia states that, ""almost 90% of students under the age of 18 have an attention span of about 10-30 minutes before becoming distracted"" (Generic_Name). This exemplifies how most students cannot stay focused in a video based classroom when there is no adult supervisor or teacher directly making sure they listen, which is quite difficult to achieve via distance learning. With this in mind, it is harder for students to have motivation to complete work during class time when they have easy access to other sources of entertainment right at their fingertips. Thus, video based learning is detrimental to student's work ethic because it gives them no motivation to complete their work whereas in the normal school system, they would be forced to work on it during class because of a direct presence of an adult supervisor keeping them on track.

This statistic shows from a student's perspective how this educational system is not even increasing the rate of obtaining high grades, which is what this option was meant to do. The interactions between a teacher and a student in a physical setting is what makes the standard class a successful system since it ensures that teachers have an equal opportunity to make the lesson as clear as possible.

An example of this is seen in Tara Westover, the famous author of the memoir,

Educated.

Westover was home schooled but was often given little time to learn because of her home obligations.

However, questioning others about our situations is better for the outcome of the experience because it brings us new perspectives. Perspective can be key to finding the solution to a problem because it allows one to look at the problem as a whole, and not just from a biased position. When blinded by a biased perspective, we force ourselves to ignore different outlooks on the situation. It is when we remove that toxic blindfold that we realize whether we are truly in the wrong or what is the true source of the conflict.

While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict.

Sometimes it takes getting a large collection of advice from different sources to piece together a comfortable solution.

As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation. Having a myopic mind can be a true curse, and taking advice from others prohibits yourself from making consequential mistakes because of being blinded by bias. Talking to others who have dealt with the similar problem allows you to feel more comfortable in your situation, and gain some peace in being to relate to another. Having others provide with different ways they would resolve the situation allows you to consider the many options and pick the best one for your situation.

36674,7fddfd2a1f9c,FAA9FC1B315B,Its not because I am attending a public high school. ,Evidence,Ineffective
36675,9e44ace4877a,FAA9FC1B315B,One of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills. ,Claim,Adequate
36676,51bfcfa31b3a,FAA9FC1B315B,when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically don't associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldn't be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dont't thing it's good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you don't understand and that they should be able to help you. They won't be able to help you if you not there with them. ,Evidence,Adequate
36677,c351cd6214d7,FAA9FC1B315B,The second reason why I disagree and I really don't think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. ,Claim,Adequate
36678,b6cb9c9a873c,FAA9FC1B315B,"Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didn't understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing.

Also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face that's my second opinion. ",Evidence,Adequate
36679,2adbc4226dbc,FAA9FC1B315B,My last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home ,Claim,Adequate
36680,31e16304039d,FAA9FC1B315B,That might affect your grade too which is very risky if you're not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . But also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to Finnish there education in a very careful way. ,Evidence,Adequate
36681,3e42be96d2f6,FAA9FC1B315B,Those are my good reason why i don't agree with online classes it's a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason why you don't actually go to the school but personally i dont agree with this situation.  ,Concluding Statement,Adequate
